## Now <a href="https://sites.google.com/temple.edu/ppl" target="_blank">Accepting Fellowship Applications</a> for the 2019-2020 Academic Year
### (Deadline: Nov 30, 2018)

<br/>
The Public Policy Lab (PPL) supports faculty and graduate student scholarship addressing either public policies themselves or social conditions and processes with implications for public policy. We welcome scholars using a wide variety of methodological approaches. We offer three types of fellowships:

1. <a href="{{ '/media/faculty-fellowship.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">Faculty</a> who apply independently and receive a course release to provide time for their work and to write a grant application.

2. <a href="{{ '/media/research-teams.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">Faculty-Graduate Student Research Teams</a> who apply together and receive a one-semester RAship for the student to work both on the faculty member’s project and the student’s own research.

3. <a href="{{ '/media/graduate-fellowship.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">Graduate students</a> who apply independently and receive support for research expenses such as conference travel.

All Fellows are appointed for one academic year.  Fellows join a diverse cohort of scholars in an interdisciplinary forum for discussion of contemporary policy issues.  They participate in our on-going PPL Fellowship Workshop in which participants present work in progress and provide feedback on each other’s written work.  Faculty members also present their work in our PPL Colloquia Series.

The College of Liberal Arts <a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/research" target="_blank">Office of Research</a> is available to <a href="{{ '/media/CLA-Grant-Support-Services.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">assist applicants and fellows</a> identifying and securing external funding for their research.

Visit our  <a href="https://sites.google.com/temple.edu/ppl" target="_blank">application page</a> to submit your materials.

<p>On the day of the MRI scan, you should avoid putting on extra hair products/accessories and glittery makeup. Some cosmetics, such as eye shadow and hair gels, may contain some metallic components that can interact with MRI magnets.</p>
<p>As a PPL fellow, I am working on developing a new set of demographic estimates of the unauthorized foreign-born population in the United States. Current research on the quantification of this population is plagued by a paucity of empirical data. These estimates will rely on publicly available Census survey data and commonly used statistical methods, and this research aims to open new avenues for social science and policy research to produce important knowledge about the size, characteristics, and economic position of the unauthorized immigrant population. Such research plays a vital role in informing ongoing academic and policy debates about the nation’s immigration dynamics and the future of America’s immigration policy.</p>
